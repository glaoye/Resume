        <h2>Reports</h2>
        <p class='description'>Along with my degree in Physics come analytical skills, critical skills and writing/presentation skills.
          Here are few examples of reports I have written displaying these skills</p>
          <hr>

          <h3>Investigating Methods for Cooling and Trapping Atoms with Hyperfine Structure</h3>

          <div class='bits'>

            <p>Summary: The focus of this report was to discuss how, and under what conditions, atoms with hyperfine structure are cooled and trapped.
            With Caesium used as the main example, I deduced the optimal wavelengths at which Caesium can be trapped without producing inconveniences in later uses, such as quantum computing and a variety of experiments.
          I also deduced the lowest temperature that Caesium can reach when subjected to an optical lattice, by producing a computer simulation to mimic laboratory conditions for an optical lattice.</p>

            <p>Summary: This investigation involved finding the specific rotation (the ability of a material to rotate polarised light) of sucrose
              solution, by measuring the phase shift of a rotating plane polarised laser beam with various concentrations of sucrose. There was also
              an attempt to measure the Verdet constant (the ability of a magnetic field to rotate polarised light propagating through a substance)
              of a salt solution - however the results were inconclusive due to not having access to a large enough magnetic field. Despite encountering
              many challenges along the way, the experiment was an enjoyable and thought-provoking one.</p>

              <p>Summary: This experiment involved measuring the viscosity of water by passing water through tubes of varying radii and measuring the subsequent rate of flow.
                As one of the larger groups I have worked in (4 members), this experiment really put my communication and team work skills to the test.
                I very much enjoyed working with the variety of characters and learning where each individuals' strengths lie. All in all, the experiment was
                an enjoyable one, provoking many suggestions, discussions and amendments. I am very satisfied with the subsequent report.</p>

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p class='description'>Here are some of my favourite programming tasks I have completed, either as part of my degree or just for fun</p>
            <hr>
            <div class='container'>
                <h3>Optimising Light Paths</h3>

                <p>This was my first programming project, assigned to me in Year 1, and what ultimately sparked my initial passion for software development.
                  The requirements were to produce a programme that would track the paths of multiple light rays as they traversed through linear and spherical
                  lenses of different shapes and orientations, before landing on a detector. The extension task was to produce a function that would optimise the
                  number of rays falling within a specified radius on the detector by changing only the radii of curvature of the spherical lenses. This project
                  was arguably the largest academic challenge I had to overcome in my degree. Training in programming was very limitted and entire concepts such as functions, loops, modules and objects were
                  either unknown or a complete blur at first. However, I rose to the challenge and revelled in the opportunity to learn new things. I am very proud of the
                  result.</p>

              <p>Along with my main programming projects, I also completed multiple smaller programming tasks in my spare time over the years. One of my
                favourites to research and implement was Random Walks - a task given to me by my level 2 Computing supevisor, after my request for more programming challenges.
                This required me to produce a programme that would track and map the path of bacterium as they converge towards areas with the highest
                food density. This involved simulating the 'run and tumble' dynamics of bacterium, where after a certain timestep, moving bacteria have a probability of tumbling and changing direction, which increases with the food density gradient.</p>

            <div class='bits'>
              <p>This was a research challenge I requested from my computing supervisor. It involved using the Newton Raphson method over 1000 iterations to
                find the roots in the complex plane of the 4th order. The programme demonstrated that plotting the outcome of each iteration produces
                fractals - a never ending, infinetly complex pattern, that are self-similar accross all scales. Such patterns are a demonstration of natural
                chaos, occuring in scenes such as trees, mountains and clouds.</p>

            <p>Red vs Grey is a creative writing piece that I took upon myself in my final month of Sixth Form, as an ode to my much loved
              previous GCSE Englsih teacher, Ms Branch. This piece is one that a re-read regularly with love and admiration. From the point of view
              of a red squirrel in the midst of an ongoing battle against the Greys, this piece delivers the message and impact that I aimed for,
              and will always remain in my heart.</p>

              <p>Garnet is one of my favourite animated characters of all time. She stars in the animated series 'Steven's Universe'
                (if you haven't watched it, you better star of future events. Last year I embarked on a mission to produce and wear an outfit
                to represent her. This took an entire day of hand stitching, and although rough in its presentation,
                I am overall proud of my perserverence and the result.</p>

            <p>This is the topic of my Level 4 project, due to be completed by Easter 2019. This project will have me exploring the possibility
              that the living cell is far more than a signalling network. With use of simulation, I will investigate
              the potential of the system to function as the building blocks of a computer, such as diodes, transistors and logic gates.</p>

            <p>As I am ever looking for ways to unite my creative passions with my technology ones, I am planning and building an application that will write sheet music based on the notes that are played/sang into it. The idea came into fruition as I am constantly trying to write sheet music for songs that I write, which is more exhausting than one may think. The Eureka moment - why not create an app that can do it for me? I am not only producing this app out of requirement, or even for love of music, but also to challenge myself.<br>
            The next step after this would be to produce a web platform where musicians (professional and aspiring) can upload tracks and sheet
            music and have other musicians make contributions, much like a musical GitHub. Suggesions from contributors would mostly be in the
            form of a track, which could overlay or append the original song. The original composer will have full control on which suggestions to add to their song. There will also be a voting system where tracks can be promoted and made more visible to the composer. Composers can send out requests if they are looking for a specific instrument to join. I would also like their to be the added feature of 'live jam sessions'. <br>
          Obviously this plan is ambitious, but that makes me ever more motivated to fufill it.</p>
