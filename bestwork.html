      <h2>Reports</h2>
      <p class='description'>Along with my degree in Physics come analytical skills, critical skills and writing/presentation skills.
        Here are few examples of reports I have written displaying these skills</p>

    <h3>Red vs Grey</h3><h4>Creative Writing</h4>
    <p>Red vs Grey is a piece of creative writing that I chose to write in my final month of Sixth Form, as an ode to my previous GCSE Englsih teacher, Ms Branch - who ignited my love for literature with her enthusiastic manner of teaching
    Although not grammatically matured as I am now, this piece delivers the message and impact that I aimed for, and it will be one that I will never forget</p>

    <h3>Garnet</h3>
    <p>Garnet is one if my favourite animated characters of all time. She stars in the animated series 'Steven's Universe'
      (if you haven't watched it, you better start) as a bold, wise and strong woman (much like myself) with the
      ability to analyse future possibilities and choose the best outcome. Last year I embarked on a mission to produce and wear an outfit
      to represent her. This took an entire day of hand stitching, and although rough in its presentation,
      I am overall proud of my perserverence and result.</p>


    <h3>Optimising Light Paths</h3>
    <p>This was my first programming project, assigned to me in Year 1, and what ultimately sparked my passion for software development.
      The requirements were to produce a programme that would track the paths of multiple light rays as they traversed through linear and spherical
      lenses of different shapes and orientations, before landing on a detector. The extension task was to produce a function that would optimise the
      number of rays falling within a specified radius on the detecter, by changing only the radii of curvature of the spherical lenses. This project
      was arguably the largest academic challenge I had to overcome in my degree. Training in programming was very limitted and entire concepts like functions, loops, modules and objects were either unknown or a complete blur at first.
      However, I rose to the challenge and revelled in the opportunity to learn new things. I am very proud of the
      result considering the circumstances.</p>

    <h3>Random Walks</h3>
    <p>Along with my main programming projects, I also completed multiple smaller programming tasks in my spare time over the years. One of my
      favourites to research and implement was Random Walks - a task given to me by my level 2 Computing supevisor, after my request for more programming challenges.
      This required me to produce a programme that would track and map the path of bacterium as they converge towards areas with the highest
      food density.</p>

    <h3>L4 Project</h3>

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Music Ventures</h3>
    <p>Although I have planned and written many songs, my supressed but present stage fright has meant my recordings aren't up to the standard
      I would like. With my growing confidence I plan to upload demo songs within the next few months. In the meantime, I am still vastly
      involved in music behind the scenes, and recordings can be provided upon request!</p>

    <h3>Fashion</h3>
    <p>With the new introduction to my family (Sylvia the sewing machine), I have planned multiple garments that I will begin
      constructing soon. Vogue better watch out!</p>
