            As a physics student, I am naturally equipped with analytical and problem solving skills the desire to be challenged.
            My keen interest in software engineering has encouraged me to learn the key fundamentals in computer science, as well as multiple programming languages.
            My passions also extend to music and the arts. The uniting of my creative and analytical skills provides me with the ability to create and fufill engaging and imaginative ideas within the technology industry.

          <h3>Intern</h3>
          <h4 class ='job'>Teach First</h4><h4 class='date'>5th – 16th June 2017</h4>

          <p>This was a two week insight programme. The first week involved learning about the fundamental attitudes and approaches regarding
            teaching, as well as the issues faced by low income students and the shortage in STEM skills in the UK. For the second week, I was
            placed in a host school to observe the teachers as well as problems faced by the school. On the final day, I was required to deliver
            a 1 hour physics lesson to Year 10 Science. The internship drastically improved my presentation, leadership and group work skills.
            It also made me a more diligent, confident character and allowed me to develop a ‘growth mindset’ outlook when approaching tasks.</p>

          <h3>Bartender</h3>
          <h4 class ='job'>Missoula</h4><h4 class='date'>April 2017 – June 2017,</h4>

          <p>Duties included preparation of drinks and cocktails to a high standard; waiting on tables, delivering food and preparing hot drinks during
            the daytime; clearing glasses and maintaining cleanliness at front of house. As a very fast paced environment, only a limited amount
            of time could be spent training me. I became adept in the job mainly through observing others and being aware of my surroundings</p>

          <p>I worked with children of various ages (4 – 16 years), assisting and leading group activities. My responsibilities included encouraging
            the children to abide by the code of conduct, and dealing compassionately with problems. I worked to maintain enthusiasm throughout the
            day to give children the best experience.  I was one of just a few first aid trained staff members and therefore responsible for
            children’s health and wellbeing</p>
