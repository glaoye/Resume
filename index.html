            As a physics student, I am naturally equipped with analytical and problem solving skills the desire to be challenged.
            My keen interest in software engineering has encouraged me to learn the key fundamentals in computer science, as well as multiple programming languages.
            My passions also extend to music and the arts. The uniting of my creative and analytical skills provides me with the ability to create and fufill engaging and imaginative ideas within the technology industry.

          <h4 class ='job'>Teach First</h4>
          <h4 class='date'>5th – 16th June 2017</h4>

          <p>This was a two week insight programme. The first week involved learning about the fundamental attitudes and approaches regarding
            teaching, as well as the issues faced by low income students and the shortage in STEM skills in the UK. For the second week, I was
            placed in a host school to observe the teachers as well as problems faced by the school. On the final day, I was required to deliver
            a 1 hour physics lesson to Year 10 Science. The internship drastically improved my presentation, leadership and group work skills.
            It also made me a more diligent, confident character and allowed me to develop a ‘growth mindset’ outlook when approaching tasks.</p>

          <p>Duties included preparation of drinks and cocktails to a high standard; waiting on tables, delivering food and preparing hot drinks during
            the daytime; clearing glasses and maintaining cleanliness at front of house. As a very fast paced environment, only a limited amount
            of time could be spent training me. I became adept in the job mainly through observing others and being aware of my surroundings</p>

          <p>I worked with children of various ages (4 – 16 years), assisting and leading group activities. My responsibilities included encouraging

          <ul>
              <li><p>I planned and delivered a challenging yet enjoyable Physics lesson to Year 10 students (Teach First). This was a massive
                achievement for me, as I have been battling stage fright most of my life.</p></li>
              <li><p>I have produced multiple physics-based simulations in Python, one of which simulates the movements and the subsequent temperature
                of photons when subjected to an optical lattice during laser cooling.</p></li>
              <li><p>I am building an application which writes sheet music based on music/notes which are sang or played into a microphone. I would also
                   like to produce a web page which allows artists to upload musical tracks, and other artists to contribute to those tracks (similar to GitHub,
                   but for music).</p></li>
              <li><p>I have attended career and technology events including: Bright Network’s Careers Fair, Bright Networks Women in TEC, ThingMonk’s
                     Technology Conference, and Business Strategy talks held by Durham University</p></li>
              <li><p>I have taken multiple online courses to develop my skills in programming and computer science, including courses from Udemy, Udacity,
                       LinkedIn and the ‘Introduction to Computer Science’ course by MIT.</p></li>

          <ul>
              <li><p>Programming languages: I am comfortable in Python, Javascript and SQL, and have a basic grasp in HTML,
                CSS, PHP and Java. I am also a frequent user of Excel.</p></li>
              <li><p>Analytical skills and problem solving are essential in my degree. I possess these skills and very much enjoy
                using them, as I love challenging myself and keeping my brain alert.</p></li>
              <li><p>II work very well in a team. My experience in team work spans a variety of situations, from Physics projects, to sports
                groups, to choral groups.</p></li>
              <li><p>I have very good communication skills. Not only am I clear and accurate in my explanations, I also have a very expressive
                and open way of presenting myself.</p></li>
              <li><p> am a considerably fast learner. I live by the logic that ‘there are 24 hours in a day’ and believe that the learning
                possibilities within a certain time frame are limitless, given one is dedicated enough.</p></li>
              <li><p>I pride myself in being curious and creative. I always take time to think outside of the box, as exciting ideas are ones
                that challenge the mind more. My love for music and the arts allows me to fabricate ideas that are a mixture between the creative and
                analytical sides of me.</p></li>

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>Music has always been a key passion of mine. I am currently a member of the St Alfege Church Choir, Greenwich. This is a skilled Anglican
            choir, requiring a high level of musicianship, attendance and discipline. I return in college vacations. I also belong to the Ultraviolet
            Choir, Greenwich, which is a contemporary choir where I put forward creative and unique ideas to develop an enriched performance.
            In my spare time, I play the piano and guitar, which I have been teaching myself from a young age. I also take time to write my own music.</p>
          <h3>Other hobbies</h3>
          <p>As a very creative person, I partake in many artistic hobbies, including fashion designing & tailoring, sketching, creative
            writing and knitting. In addition, since starting university I play basketball and tennis, both of which have improved my
            communication skills and coordination. This year I have also started learning ballet, which has increased my awareness of my body.</p>
