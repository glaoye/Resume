      <h2>Be Determined</h2>
      <h3>As a wise man once said - "Nobody said it was easy"</h3>
      <p>What frustrates me more than anything is when I hear people say "I can't...". Us as humans have brains that are capable of amazing things. We sent the first man into space with a mere scientific calculator as our fundamental tool. The boundaries are limitless.
        The only <i>real</i> restrictions we have are, in all aspects, fabricated, as they are the ones we set ourselves. If one was truly determined enough (and I mean <i>truly</i> determined enough), they would dedicate as much time and energy as practically possible to completing a goal.
        <b>There are an entire <i>24 hours</i> in a day</b> - the possibilities in that amount of time, let alone in a number days or weeks are truly endless. Let go of all inhibitions and just bloody do it.

    <h2>Be Creative<h2>
      <h3>The Medicine for the Soul</h3>
      <p>Creativity is one of the key things that sustain a happy mind and a happy heart. It forms a fruitful marriage with the systematic side of the brain to produce outcomes that are a perfect balance of both.
        It is important to me that this is incorperated in everything I do - my work, my assignments and my spare time. Igniting one's creative side is one of the key ingredients to maintaining the passion and enjoyment in the work you do,
        producing results that are outside the realms of normality and allowing the fruits of your labour to reach their full potential.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Have a Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>"I can achieve anything"</h3>
      <p>Nobody is perfect, but everybody is capable. The ability for one to acknowledge certain aspects that need building upon, and how to
        build upon them is really what determines ones character. It is important to not let your failures keep you down,
        and to know that growing, learning and developing your character is truly a beautiful and essential thing. Motivation and
        ability to grow are just as much an engine as the beating of the heart.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Be Willing to Learn</h2>
      <h3>There are 24 hours in a day</h3>
      <p>Learning is something that all humans should embrace throughout their entire life. Learning new things is honestly what I enjoy doing
        the most - as it really keeps me excited and once again, opens the realms for which your brain can think and explore.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h2>Be Ambitious</h2>
      <h3>Open your horizons</h3>
      <p>One piece of advice I give to everybody (who asks for it) is <b>do not settle</b>.
        Life is way too short to be merely just content with where you are. There are so many incredible opportunities in
        this world that are acheivable if sights are set high enough. Always challenge yourself. After all, if your dreams don't scare you, <i>they are not large enough!</i>.</p>
